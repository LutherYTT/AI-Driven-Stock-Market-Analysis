**Sentiment Analysis:**  
The news sentiment is overwhelmingly positive for Xiaomi, driven by:  
1) Mass production announcement of its self-developed 3nm "Xuanjie O1" chip (a major technological milestone)  
2) Strong market reception for its SU7/YU7 electric vehicles  
3) Continued R&D investments (plan to invest 69B USD in chips over 10 years)  
4) Renewed partnership with Qualcomm  
Technical indicators support bullish momentum - the stock closed at 54.8 (near 30-day high), above all key MAs (20/50/200), with RSI at 68.9 showing strong but not overbought conditions.  

**Short comment:**  
Xiaomi is riding multiple catalysts - semiconductor breakthroughs + EV momentum + AIoT ecosystem growth. While the SUV market is competitive, its vertical integration with self-designed chips provides unique differentiation. Short-term target 58-60 with medium-term upside if chip adoption scales. Monitor US-China tech tensions as key risk.  

(Note: Volatility score of 4.48 suggests using stop-loss below 50.8)
