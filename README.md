## 📈 AI-Driven Stock Market Analysis  
*A comprehensive framework for stock market forecasting using time series analysis, news sentiment integration, and deep learning.*

---

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project integrates **multimodal data sources** (historical stock prices, technical indicators, and news sentiment) with machine learning models to provide actionable insights into stock market trends. It combines quantitative analysis (LSTM forecasting, volatility clustering, backtesting) with qualitative news sentiment analysis via the DeepSeek API to generate trading recommendations. The system is designed for academic research and exploratory financial analysis.

---

## ✨ Key Features  
1. **Time Series Analysis**  
   - Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, ADX, Bollinger Bands).  
   - Volatility clustering and anomaly detection.  
   - Interactive visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib.  

2. **News Sentiment Integration**  
   - Web scraping from Google News, Yahoo Finance, Sina, and AAStocks.  
   - Sentiment aggregation for AI-driven analysis.  

3. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - LSTM-based price forecasting (univariate and multivariate).  
   - Backtesting strategies using Backtrader.  

4. **AI-Powered Recommendations**  
   - Integration with DeepSeek API for risk assessment and trading signals.  
   - Automated report generation with buy/sell recommendations.

## 🛠️ Installation  
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/LutherYTT/AI-Driven-Stock-Market-Analysis.git
   cd AI-Driven-Stock-Market-Analysis
   ```  

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**  
   - Add your DeepSeek API key to `deepseek_integration.py`:  
     ```python  
     api_key = 'your-api-key-here'  
     ```  

4. **Create Output Directories**  
   ```bash  
   mkdir -p ./output/{stock_id}  # Replace {stock_id} with target ticker (e.g., 01810)  
   ```  

---

## 🚀 Usage  

### 1. Fetch Historical Data & Run Analysis  
```bash  
python time_series_analysis.py --ticker "01810.HK" --years 10  
```  
- Outputs: Enhanced CSV files, interactive charts, and statistical reports.  

### 2. Scrape News Articles  
```bash  
python web_crawlers.py --ticker "01810.HK" 
```  
- Outputs: CSV files in `./output/{stock_id}/` with news from Google, Yahoo, Sina, and AAStocks.  

### 3. Generate AI Recommendations  
```bash  
python deepseek_integration.py --ticker "01810.HK" --model "deepseek-reasoner"
```  
- Outputs: `Deepseet_Output.txt` with trading signals and risk assessments.  

### 4. Price Forecasting  
```python  
from price_forecast import lstm_price_prediction  
lstm_price_prediction(df, stock_id)  # Use preprocessed data  
```  
- Outputs: Forecast plots and model checkpoints.
