# AI-Driven Stock Market Analysis: Integrating Multimodal Data and Machine Learning for Predictive Insights

## 📈 AI-Driven Stock Market Analysis  
*A comprehensive framework for stock market forecasting using time series analysis, news sentiment integration, and deep learning.*

---

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project integrates **multimodal data sources** (historical stock prices, technical indicators, and news sentiment) with machine learning models to provide actionable insights into stock market trends. It combines quantitative analysis (LSTM forecasting, volatility clustering, backtesting) with qualitative news sentiment analysis via the DeepSeek API to generate trading recommendations. The system is designed for academic research and exploratory financial analysis.

1. **Time Series Analysis**  
   - Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, ADX, Bollinger Bands).  
   - Volatility clustering and anomaly detection.  
   - Interactive visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib.  

2. **News Sentiment Integration**  
   - Web scraping from Google News, Yahoo Finance, Sina, and AAStocks.  
   - Sentiment aggregation for AI-driven analysis.  

3. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - LSTM-based price forecasting (univariate and multivariate).  
   - Backtesting strategies using Backtrader.  

4. **AI-Powered Recommendations**  
   - Integration with DeepSeek API for risk assessment and trading signals.  
   - Automated report generation with buy/sell recommendations.

## 🚀 Usage  

### 1. Fetch Historical Data & Run Analysis  
```bash  
python time_series_analysis.py --ticker "01810.HK" --years 10  
```  
- Outputs: Enhanced CSV files, interactive charts, and statistical reports.  

### 2. Scrape News Articles  
```bash  
python web_crawlers.py --ticker "01810.HK" 
```  
- Outputs: CSV files in `./output/{stock_id}/` with news from Google, Yahoo, Sina, and AAStocks.  

### 3. Generate AI Recommendations  
```bash  
python deepseek_integration.py --ticker "01810.HK" --model "deepseek-reasoner"
```  
- Outputs: `Deepseet_Output.txt` with trading signals and risk assessments.

   ```
   Here is the analysis for stock 01810 (Xiaomi Corporation):
   
   Stock risk (1-5): 3  
   Short-term up/down forecast (~5 days): up  
   Medium-term up/down forecast (~30 days): small up  
   Stock Price Trend: Up  
   Recommended Buy Price: 52.8 - 53.5  
   Recommended Sell Price: 58.0 - 60.0  
   
   **Sentiment Analysis:**  
   The news sentiment is overwhelmingly positive for Xiaomi, driven by:  
   1) Mass production announcement of its self-developed 3nm "Xuanjie O1" chip (a major technological milestone)  
   2) Strong market reception for its SU7/YU7 electric vehicles  
   3) Continued R&D investments (plan to invest 69B USD in chips over 10 years)  
   4) Renewed partnership with Qualcomm  
   Technical indicators support bullish momentum - the stock closed at 54.8 (near 30-day high), above all key MAs (20/50/200), with RSI at 68.9 showing strong but not overbought conditions.  
   
   **Short comment:**  
   Xiaomi is riding multiple catalysts - semiconductor breakthroughs + EV momentum + AIoT ecosystem growth. While the SUV market is competitive, its vertical integration with self-designed chips provides unique differentiation. Short-term target 58-60 with medium-term upside if chip adoption scales. Monitor US-China tech tensions as key risk.  
   
   (Note: Volatility score of 4.48 suggests using stop-loss below 50.8)
